## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 🎯 **Product Objective**
Build a simple, reliable local application that discovers 40-50 Product Manager job postings daily, scores them against a personalized PM profile, and delivers 10 relevant jobs every 6 hours via Telegram to enable 25+ daily job applications.

### 📊 **Success Metrics**
- **Primary KPI**: Enable 25+ job applications per day (175+ per week)
- **Job Discovery**: 40-50 PM jobs found daily (minimum 280/week)
- **Quality**: Average relevance score >70 for delivered jobs
- **Reliability**: >98% successful batch delivery rate
- **Efficiency**: <5% duplicate jobs sent

### 👤 **User Story**
*"As a Product Manager actively job searching, I want to receive 10 highly relevant PM job opportunities every 6 hours with relevance scores, so I can quickly review and apply to 25+ positions daily without manually searching job boards."*

### 🔧 **Functional Requirements**

#### Core Features (MVP)
- **Job Discovery**: Monitor RSS feeds + LinkedIn for PM positions
- **Intelligent Scoring**: 0-100 relevance score based on configurable PM profile
- **Batch Delivery**: 4 batches of 10 jobs daily (every 6 hours)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Track sent jobs for 30 days to avoid repeats
- **Telegram Notifications**: Clean, formatted job alerts with apply links
- **Local Execution**: Cron-based automation, no cloud dependencies

#### Advanced Features (Phase 2)
- **Score Explanation**: Why each job received its score
- **Company Intelligence**: Basic company info (size, stage, industry)
- **Application Tracking**: Simple sent job history
- **Feed Performance**: Monitor which sources provide best jobs

### 📐 **Technical Requirements**
- **Runtime**: Python 3.9+ on local macOS/Linux
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (feedparser, requests, python-telegram-bot)
- **Storage**: Simple text files, no database required
- **Memory**: <50MB during operation
- **Network**: Standard internet connection
- **Scheduling**: Local cron job execution

### 🚫 **Non-Requirements**
- Web interface or dashboard

- Real-time job alerts (batched delivery acceptable)
- Advanced analytics or reporting

### 🎯 **Acceptance Criteria**

#### Epic 1: Job Discovery & Scoring
- **AC1.1**: System discovers 40+ PM jobs daily from RSS feeds + LinkedIn
- **AC1.2**: Each job receives 0-100 relevance score based on configured profile
- **AC1.3**: Jobs scoring <60 are automatically filtered out
- **AC1.4**: Duplicate jobs are detected and prevented within 30-day window

#### Epic 2: Batch Delivery System
- **AC2.1**: System delivers exactly 10 jobs every 6 hours (4 batches daily)
- **AC2.2**: Telegram messages are clearly formatted with job details and scores
- **AC2.3**: Each job includes title, company, location, salary, score, and apply link
- **AC2.4**: Jobs are visually separated with clear spacing in messages

#### Epic 3: Configuration & Reliability
- **AC3.1**: All preferences configurable via JSON files (no code changes)
- **AC3.2**: System runs reliably for 6+ months with minimal maintenance
- **AC3.3**: Failed RSS feeds don't break the entire system
- **AC3.4**: LinkedIn integration provides 20+ jobs daily as primary source

### ⚙️ **Configuration Validation System**

#### **Validation Rules**
1. **Required Fields**: All essential profile fields must be present
2. **Data Types**: Numeric ranges, string arrays, boolean flags validated
3. **Logical Consistency**: Experience years vs. seniority level alignment
4. **URL Validation**: All RSS feed URLs must be accessible
5. **Telegram Credentials**: Bot token and chat ID must be valid

#### **Default Fallbacks**
- Missing skills → Use generic PM skill list
- Invalid scoring weights → Reset to balanced defaults
- Broken RSS feeds → Disable temporarily, use backups
- Missing preferences → Use conservative defaults

#### **Configuration Hot Reload**
- System checks for config changes before each batch
- Updates applied without restart for most settings
- Critical changes (Telegram credentials) require restart
- Invalid changes logged but don't break execution

## Process Flow & Simplified Scoring

### 🔍 **Job Discovery Process**

#### **Multi-Source Discovery Strategy**
```
LinkedIn (Primary - 60% of jobs)
├── Search API queries for PM roles
├── Geographic filtering
├── Date range limiting (past 24 hours)
├── Experience level matching
└── Company size filtering

RSS Feeds (Secondary - 30% of jobs)  
├── WeWorkRemotely product jobs
├── Remotive general feed (filtered)
├── Himalayas remote jobs
├── Company-specific feeds
└── Backup sources (Indeed, StackOverflow)

Company Feeds (Tertiary - 10% of jobs)
├── Preferred company career pages
├── High-priority company alerts
└── Startup job boards
```

#### **Job Data Normalization**
Each discovered job standardized to:
```
JobData = {
    'id': 'unique_identifier',
    'title': 'normalized_job_title',
    'company': 'company_name',
    'location': 'city_state_or_remote',
    'salary_range': 'min_max_or_null',
    'experience_required': 'years_or_level',
    'skills_mentioned': ['skill1', 'skill2'],
    'industry': 'detected_industry',
    'description': 'full_job_description',
    'apply_url': 'application_link',
    'source': 'linkedin|rss_feed_name',
    'posted_date': 'iso_timestamp',
    'expires_date': 'iso_timestamp_or_null'
}
```

### 🎯 **Simplified Scoring Algorithm (0-100 Points)**

#### **5-Factor Scoring System**

**1. Title Match (30 points maximum)**
```
Perfect Match → 30 points
├── Job title exactly matches primary_titles
├── "Product Manager" = "Product Manager" → 30 pts
├── "Senior Product Manager" = "Senior Product Manager" → 30 pts

Close Match → 20 points  
├── Job title contains primary title words
├── "Senior PM" when looking for "Product Manager" → 20 pts
├── "Product Lead" when looking for "Product Manager" → 20 pts

Partial Match → 10 points
├── Contains "Product" or "Manager" 
├── "Product Owner" → 10 pts
├── "Program Manager" → 10 pts

No Match → 0 points
├── Unrelated titles get no points
```

**2. Skills Match (25 points maximum)**
```
Skills Matching Logic:
├── Count how many of your skills appear in job description
├── Each matched skill from core_pm_skills = 3 points
├── Each matched skill from technical_skills = 2 points  
├── Maximum 25 points total

Example:
├── Your skills: ["product strategy", "sql", "figma", "agile"]
├── Job mentions: "product strategy", "sql", "analytics"  
├── Score: (3 + 2) = 5 points (capped at 25)
```

**3. Experience Match (20 points maximum)**
```
Experience Level Alignment:
├── Required years ≤ Your years → 20 points
├── Required years = Your years + 1 → 15 points  
├── Required years = Your years + 2 → 10 points
├── Required years > Your years + 2 → 0 points

Example:
├── You have 5 years, job requires 4-6 years → 20 points
├── You have 3 years, job requires 5+ years → 0 points
```

**4. Industry Match (15 points maximum)**
```
Industry Alignment:
├── Job industry in primary_experience → 15 points
├── Job industry in secondary_experience → 10 points
├── Job industry in interested_in → 8 points
├── No industry match → 0 points

Example:
├── Your primary: ["fintech", "saas"]
├── Job at fintech company → 15 points
├── Job at healthcare company (not in your list) → 0 points
```

**5. Company Match (10 points maximum)**
```
Company Preferences:
├── Company in preferred_companies → 10 points
├── Company stage/size matches preferences → 5 points
├── No specific preference match → 0 points

Company Penalties:
├── Company in avoid_companies → -20 points (can make total negative)
├── Industry in avoid_industries → -15 points
```

#### **Bonus Points (Up to +10 points)**
```
Special Bonuses:
├── Remote work (if you prefer remote) → +5 points
├── Salary above your target → +3 points
├── Equity mentioned → +2 points
├── Recent posting (<24 hours) → +2 points

Quality Penalties:
├── Vague job description → -5 points
├── No salary information → -2 points
├── Third-party recruiter → -3 points
```

#### **Simple Scoring Implementation**
```
def calculate_simple_score(job, profile):
    score = 0
    reasons = []
    
    # 1. Title Match (30 points max)
    title_score = match_job_title(job.title, profile.primary_titles)
    score += title_score
    if title_score > 0:
        reasons.append(f"Title match: {title_score} pts")
    
    # 2. Skills Match (25 points max)  
    skills_score = count_matching_skills(job.description, profile.skills)
    score += min(25, skills_score * 3)  # 3 points per skill, max 25
    if skills_score > 0:
        reasons.append(f"{skills_score} skills match")
    
    # 3. Experience Match (20 points max)
    exp_score = match_experience_level(job.experience_required, profile.years_experience)
    score += exp_score
    if exp_score > 0:
        reasons.append(f"Experience level match: {exp_score} pts")
    
    # 4. Industry Match (15 points max)
    industry_score = match_industry(job.industry, profile.industries)  
    score += industry_score
    if industry_score > 0:
        reasons.append(f"Industry match: {industry_score} pts")
    
    # 5. Company Match (10 points max)
    company_score = match_company_preference(job.company, profile.company_preferences)
    score += company_score
    if company_score != 0:
        reasons.append(f"Company preference: {company_score} pts")
    
    # Bonuses and penalties
    bonus_score = calculate_bonuses(job, profile)
    score += bonus_score
    if bonus_score > 0:
        reasons.append(f"Bonus points: {bonus_score}")
    
    return max(0, min(100, score)), reasons
```

#### **Score Interpretation**
```
Score Ranges:
├── 85-100: Exceptional match (🔥)
├── 70-84: Strong match (⭐)  
├── 60-69: Good match (✨)
├── 45-59: Marginal (filtered out)
├── 0-44: Poor match (filtered out)

Only jobs scoring 60+ are sent to user
```

## LinkedIn Integration Strategy

### 🔗 **LinkedIn Integration Approach**

#### **Primary Strategy: LinkedIn Job Search URLs**
LinkedIn presents unique challenges as they don't offer public RSS feeds and restrict API access. Our approach:

**Method 1: LinkedIn Job Search URLs (Primary)**
```
Constructed Search URLs:
├── Base: linkedin.com/jobs/search
├── Keywords: ?keywords=product+manager
├── Location: &location=remote
├── Date: &f_TPR=r86400 (past 24 hours)
├── Experience: &f_E=3,4 (mid-senior level)
└── Company Size: &f_C=51-200,201-500,501-1000

Example URL:
https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=product%20manager&location=remote&f_TPR=r86400&f_E=3,4
```

**Method 2: LinkedIn Company Pages (Secondary)**  
```
Company-Specific Searches:
├── Target preferred companies from config
├── Direct company career page monitoring
├── Recent job posting extraction
└── Higher relevance due to company preference
```

**Method 3: Third-Party LinkedIn Aggregators (Backup)**
```
Reliable Services:
├── Remotive (includes LinkedIn jobs)
├── AngelList (syncs with LinkedIn)  
├── Indeed (scrapes LinkedIn)
└── Glassdoor (mirrors LinkedIn)
```

#### **LinkedIn Data Extraction Process**

**Step 1: Job Discovery**
```
Daily LinkedIn Sweep:
09:00 → Search for "Product Manager" + Remote
09:15 → Search for "Senior Product Manager" + Major cities  
09:30 → Search preferred companies directly
09:45 → Process and normalize all discovered jobs
```

**Step 2: Data Parsing & Extraction**
```
Extract from LinkedIn HTML/JSON:
├── Job Title → Clean and standardize
├── Company Name → Match against preferences  
├── Location → Parse remote/hybrid/onsite
├── Job Description → Full text extraction
├── Salary Range → Parse when available
├── Posted Date → Convert to standard format
├── Application URL → Direct LinkedIn apply link
└── Company Info → Size, industry, description
```

**Step 3: LinkedIn-Specific Scoring Adjustments**
```
LinkedIn Source Bonuses:
├── LinkedIn job posts → +3 base points
├── Easy Apply enabled → +2 points  
├── Recently posted (<12 hours) → +2 points
├── Company actively hiring (multiple roles) → +1 point
└── High engagement job post → +1 point
```

#### **LinkedIn Rate Limiting & Compliance**

**Respectful Usage Patterns**
```
Rate Limiting Strategy:
├── Max 50 requests per hour
├── 2-second delays between requests
├── Randomized request timing
├── User-agent rotation
└── IP-based throttling awareness

Compliance Measures:
├── No automated applications
├── Respect robots.txt
├── Human-like browsing patterns  
├── Limited concurrent connections
└── Error handling for blocked requests
```

**Backup Strategy for LinkedIn Blocks**
```
If LinkedIn Access Limited:
├── Increase reliance on RSS feeds
├── Activate backup aggregator sources
├── Notify user of reduced LinkedIn coverage
├── Implement alternative search strategies
└── Resume LinkedIn access after cooldown period
```

## File Storage System

### 💾 **Simple File-Based Storage Design**

#### **Storage Architecture Philosophy**
- **No Database Complexity**: Simple text files for maximum reliability

## Error Handling & Reliability

### 🛡️ **Comprehensive Error Handling Strategy**

#### **Critical Failure Points & Mitigation**

**1. LinkedIn Access Failures (HIGH RISK)**
```
Failure Scenarios:
├── IP blocked by LinkedIn → Switch to mobile user agents + delays
├── Rate limiting → Implement exponential backoff + request queuing
├── CAPTCHA challenges → Skip current cycle, retry next batch
├── Account suspension → Switch to RSS-heavy mode
└── API changes → Graceful degradation with error logging

Mitigation Strategies:
├── Multiple LinkedIn search approaches (URL variations)
├── Backup aggregator sources (Remotive, AngelList)
├── RSS feed prioritization when LinkedIn unavailable
├── User notification of reduced LinkedIn coverage
└── Automatic retry with longer intervals

Recovery Timeline:
├── Immediate: Switch to backup sources
├── 1 hour: Retry LinkedIn with modified approach
├── 6 hours: Attempt full LinkedIn restoration
├── 24 hours: Manual intervention notification
└── Weekly: Review and update LinkedIn strategy
```

**2. RSS Feed Source Failures (MEDIUM RISK)**
```
Failure Scenarios:
├── Feed URL returns 404/500 → Mark feed as temporarily disabled
├── Malformed XML/RSS → Skip individual entries, continue processing
├── Feed format changes → Log errors, attempt parsing with fallbacks
├── Network timeouts → Retry with exponential backoff
└── SSL certificate issues → Attempt HTTP fallback if secure fails

Resilience Mechanisms:
├── Feed health monitoring with automatic disabling
├── Multiple RSS sources for redundancy
├── Graceful parsing with error tolerance
├── Automatic feed re-enablement after cooldown period
└── User notification only for major source outages
