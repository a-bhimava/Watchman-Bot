# 📤 Distribution Guide - Sharing PM Watchman

Guide for distributing PM Watchman to your classmates and friends while maintaining system reliability.

## 🎯 Distribution Strategy

**Recommended Approach**: **Individual Cloned Instances**
- Each person runs their own complete system
- Maintains privacy, reliability, and simplicity
- No shared failure points or rate limiting issues

## 🚀 How to Share with Classmates

### Step 1: Convert to GitHub Template

1. **Go to your GitHub repository settings**
2. **Scroll to "Template repository" section**  
3. **Check "Template repository" box**
4. **Save changes**

Now anyone can click "Use this template" to create their own copy!

### Step 2: Share the Setup Instructions

Send your classmates this simple message:

---

**📱 Message Template:**

> Hey! I built an automated PM job search system that finds 40+ relevant jobs daily and sends them via Telegram. It's been working great for my job search!
> 
> **Get your own copy (15 min setup):**
> 1. Go to: https://github.com/a-bhimava/pm-watchman
> 2. Click "Use this template" (green button)
> 3. Clone your new repo and run: `python3 scripts/quick_setup.py`
> 4. Follow the setup prompts
> 
> **What you'll get:**
> ✅ 40+ PM jobs delivered daily via Telegram
> ✅ Intelligent scoring based on your profile  
> ✅ No duplicates, fully automated
> ✅ Runs locally on your computer
>
> Let me know if you need help with setup!

### Step 3: Provide Support

**Common questions and answers:**

**Q: "Do I need to create my own Telegram bot?"**  
A: Yes! Each person needs their own bot for privacy. The setup script guides you through this (takes 3 minutes).

**Q: "Will this interfere with your system?"**  
A: No! Each system is completely independent. If yours breaks, mine keeps working.

**Q: "What if I want different job preferences?"**  
A: Perfect! You customize the `config/pm_profile.json` file with your specific experience, skills, and preferences.

**Q: "How much maintenance does this need?"**  
A: Almost none. It's designed to run autonomously for months. Maybe 15 minutes weekly to check logs.

## 🔧 Advanced Distribution Options

### Option 1: Private Organization Repository

For close friends or study group:

1. **Create a GitHub organization**
2. **Make the repository private within the org**
3. **Invite specific people as collaborators**
4. **Each person still clones their own instance**

Benefits: More control over who has access

### Option 2: Direct Repository Sharing

For individual sharing:

1. **Share the direct GitHub link**
2. **They fork or clone the repository**
3. **Follow the same setup process**

### Option 3: Zip File Distribution

For non-technical friends:

1. **Download repository as ZIP**
2. **Share the ZIP file directly**
3. **Include printed setup instructions**

## 📊 Success Metrics for Distribution

**Individual Success** (per person):
- ✅ 40+ PM jobs discovered daily

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### What NOT to Do:

❌ **Don't share Telegram bot tokens** - Each person needs their own  
❌ **Don't run multiple instances on one computer** - Resource conflicts  
❌ **Don't modify the core system for "multi-user"** - Breaks simplicity

### What TO Do:

✅ **Encourage individual setup** - Maintains system reliability
