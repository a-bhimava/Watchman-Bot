ðŸ“± **I built an automated PM job search system - want your own copy?**

**What it does:**
- Finds 50-150+ PM jobs every 6 hours from multiple LinkedIn RSS feeds
- Delivers top 20 most relevant jobs to your Telegram with simple Apply/Dismiss interface
- Accurate company extraction (shows actual companies, not "LinkedIn")
- Runs 24/7 on your computer with clean HTML formatting and reliable delivery

**15-minute setup:**
1. **Get your copy**: https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/pm-watchman â†’ Click "Use this template"
2. **Create Telegram bot**: Text @BotFather, send `/newbot`, get your token
3. **Install & run**: `pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 run_watchman.py telegram --interval 6`
4. **Pre-configured**: Comes with 2 working LinkedIn RSS feeds, no setup needed
5. **Add more feeds**: Follow instructions in `config/job_sources.json` to add additional RSS feeds

**Results I'm seeing:**
- âœ… 50-150+ jobs found every 6 hours from dual RSS feeds
- âœ… Clean job delivery with actual company names (Appian, Stord, etc.)
- âœ… Simple 2-button interface: Apply (opens link) or Dismiss (deletes message)
